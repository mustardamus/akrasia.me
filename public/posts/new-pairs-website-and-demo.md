### [Pairs.io](http://pairs.io)

#### Website

Completely redone. I stick with the one-pager but make it scrollable. The site
is mainly build around the demo, which is a slideshow, with additional info to
be found when scrolling down.

#### Demo

Slightly extended. In the last demo there was only a one way communication, from
the remote to the desktop. Now it's two ways, update the slide on the remote and
sending commands from it.
